# Specifications for the CLI Assessment

Specs:
- [x] Have a CLI for interfacing with the application: My gem relies on user input to display cupcake recipes. First, the gem prompts the user to enter a category of cupcake recipes. Then, the gem will ask which recipe specifically the user wants to see and output it accordingly. In both steps, the user is allowed to type 'exit' and invalid input prompts the user to reenter.
- [x] Pull data from an external source: My gem scraps from three baking/food blogs: Natasha's Kitchen, Sugar Spun Run, and Sally's Baking Addiction. 
- [x] Implement both list and detail views: My gem implements a list view scraping the blogs for all the recipes of each blog in each category (vanilla, chocolate, and other). Then, my gem implements a detail view scraping each individual recipe for its ingredients and directions.
